# CigarTracer
Automatically create Tracetables for existing Pythoncode without any hustle!

# Status
**PRE-ALPHA -> NOT WORKING**

The CigarTracer-Project is still in development.

Currently, I am writing the algorythm to manipulate the original string so it includes python code
to store the current state of a variable, as well as its "SD"-value which has also to be tracked by
another code I have to include into the smoke_code()-function. I think I will need about 2-4 hours
of work to complete the program until I can release an alpha version, about one more week for a
beta version which will eventually become perpetual.

**Estimated release date: 6th January 2022**

# Tutorial
Since the Software is still in development, I can't really give
you helpfull information yet.

As soon as a working version of CigarTracer is available, an executable (.exe) file will be 
inside a folder named "release". Your anti-virus-program is probably not very happy to encounter
this kind of file wherefore you have to convince it that CigarTracer isn't malicious.

If you are conserned about that, feel free to read the whole source code and
also actively contribute to it; the whole CigarTracer project is OpenSource!
