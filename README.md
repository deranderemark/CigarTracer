# CigarTracer
Automatically create Tracetables for existing Pythoncode

## Status
**NOT WORKING**

The CigarTracer-Project is still in development.
It may be available on Sunday, the 30th January 2022.

Currently, the comments inside the python files are only available in german. I may translate
them and completely switch to English.

## Tutorial
Since the Software is still in development, I can't really give
you helpfull information yet.
